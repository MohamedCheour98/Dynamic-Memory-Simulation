# Dynamic-Memory-Simulation

This is a C application that allows the user (in this case a software engineer) to allocate memory dynamically using malloc() and free(). 

It simulates heap memory which is the portion of RAM (Random Access Memory) where dynamically allocated memory resides (memory allocated via malloc). Memory allocated from the heap will remain allocated until one of the following occurs:

1-The memory is freed using free().  
2-The program terminates.
